Wagtail Admin Theme
===

This is not perfect. It just lets you get moving quickly (v1.10) and do some dirty stuff like change colors and things.

If you just want CSS changes:

`npm run styles`

Copy the `wagtail/wagtailadmin/static/wagtailadmin/css` folder into an app in your own app with the path of: `static/wagtailadmin/css` and you'll be good to go.
